MCTS which is done in 4 steps:
1. Selection: The algorithm travels from the root of the tree to a leaf node,
using heuristics like the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) to balance exploration and exploitation
2. Expansion: If the selected node isn/'t terminal,
MCTS expands the tree by adding child nodes representing possible future actions.
3. Simulation (Rollout): A random playout is run from the new node to a terminal state,
estimating its potential value.
4. Backpropagation: The results of the simulation are then propagated up the treeâ€¦"""
